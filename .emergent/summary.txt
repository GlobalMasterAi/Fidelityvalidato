The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily focused on stabilizing and enhancing the ImaGross loyalty application for production deployment. Initially, the engineer resolved various deployment issues including 503 health check failures, container readiness timeouts, and MongoDB Atlas connection problems. This involved significant backend refactoring in  to implement asynchronous data loading, robust health/readiness probes with  prefixes, and optimized MongoDB connection parameters. Post-deployment, the focus shifted to fixing data loading inconsistencies; specifically, ensuring all 30K+ loyalty data and 1M+ sales records were correctly loaded into MongoDB instead of remaining in RAM to prevent memory overloads. Finally, the engineer addressed critical frontend dashboard visualization bugs where real data was not being displayed, despite correct API responses. The final issue identified was a mismatch in data mapping for specific cards on the admin dashboard, leading to zero values.

<product_requirements>
The ImaGross loyalty application is designed to manage customer loyalty points, offering user signup, digital loyalty card generation, and a comprehensive Super Admin Dashboard. The dashboard's functionality evolved from basic management to include advanced analytics, such as graphs, filters, and RFM segmentation, and a Personal User Area for spending insights and gamification. Recent explicit requests, which formed the core of this work, included:
1. Enhancing user registration to enforce mandatory  (last name) and  (physical card number) validation.
2. Implementing multi-format user login (physical card number, email, or phone number).
3. Developing comprehensive sales analytics for the Super Admin dashboard, processing a large  dataset, including detailed customer, product, department, and promotion insights, with visualizations and data export.
4. Ensuring the application is stable and fully functional in a production environment, resolving all compilation, runtime, and deployment errors, specifically issues related to data loading and dashboard display.

<pending_tasks>
- Fix the frontend Admin Dashboard to correctly display data for Clienti (Customers), Prodotti (Products), and Bollini (Loyalty Points) cards, as they are currently showing zeros despite backend APIs returning correct data.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on resolving a critical frontend visualization bug where the Admin Dashboard () was displaying zero values for some key metrics, even though the backend APIs were confirmed to be returning the correct, comprehensive data from the MongoDB database.

The engineer identified that the  component was initially calling incorrect or non-existent API endpoints (, ). This was corrected to call the validated  endpoint for sales data and a newly created  endpoint for loyalty data.

Furthermore, a specific mapping issue was identified where the frontend was attempting to read  for revenue and sales, but the backend response was structured differently. This was fixed by aligning the frontend's data access to  and .

At the very last message, the AI engineer confirmed that the Fatturato Totale Vendite and Vendite cards on the dashboard were now correctly displaying real data (e.g., â‚¬3.584.524,55 and 1.067.280 sales). However, the Clienti (Customers), Prodotti (Products), and Bollini (Loyalty Points) cards were still showing zeros or Loading, indicating persistent mapping or rendering issues for these specific UI elements. The current state is that some dashboard cards are fixed, while others are not.
