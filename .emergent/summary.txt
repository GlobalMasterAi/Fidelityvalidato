The AI engineer's trajectory focused on stabilizing and enhancing the ImaGross loyalty application. Key challenges included persistent data loading issues to MongoDB Atlas, ensuring correct frontend display of analytics (moving from zero values to real data), and resolving critical deployment failures. The work involved iterative debugging of backend data ingestion scripts (especially for large sales and fidelity datasets), correcting frontend API calls and data mapping in  and  (login/redirect issues), and addressing environment variable inconsistencies. A significant recurring problem was the inexplicable loss or reversion of MongoDB Atlas data after deployments or restarts, requiring repeated data re-uploads and troubleshooting of backend startup logic to ensure data persistence and availability. The most recent efforts revolve around ensuring the latest fidelity data is visible after repeated data loss.

The ImaGross loyalty application provides a comprehensive system for managing customer loyalty, offering user signup, digital loyalty card generation, and an advanced Super Admin Dashboard. The primary objective was to expand dashboard capabilities to include detailed analytics (graphs, filters, RFM segmentation) and a Personal User Area for insights and gamification.

Explicit development requests and problems addressed include:
1.  **User Registration & Login**: Mandate  and  validation during signup, and enable multi-format login via physical card number, email, or phone.
2.  **Comprehensive Sales Analytics**: Develop a Super Admin dashboard to process large sales datasets () for insights into customers, products, departments, and promotions, with visualizations and export functions.
3.  **Production Stability & Functionality**: Ensure full operation in a production Kubernetes environment. This involved resolving compilation, runtime, and deployment errors, specifically fixing dashboard metrics showing zero values despite correct backend data, ensuring all 30,000+ loyalty clients were visible, and ensuring data persistence in MongoDB Atlas.

    -   **Summary**: The core FastAPI backend, handling API endpoints for user authentication, loyalty, and extensive sales/loyalty analytics.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   **MongoDB Integration**: Migrated from in-memory data to MongoDB Atlas. Implemented asynchronous data loading on startup into , , and  collections. Refactored logic to read from these persistent collections.
        -   **API Endpoints**: Adjusted , , and  to query MongoDB directly for aggregated and detailed data.
        -   **Health & Deployment Probes**: Added , , , , , ,  endpoints for Kubernetes.
        -   **Error Handling & Logging**: Enhanced for robust database operations and data loading.
        -   **Production Startup**: Modified to prevent heavy data loading during initial container startup to avoid 503 timeouts, with a  endpoint introduced for post-deployment data ingestion.
        -   **CORS**: Configured for production environment.
        -   **Data Fields**: Adjusted to use  for revenue calculation.
-   
    -   **Summary**: React component displaying aggregated sales and loyalty data for the Super Admin Dashboard.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   **API Endpoint Correction**: Updated API calls from incorrect or demo endpoints to  and .
        -   **Data Mapping**: Corrected data mapping to accurately display , , , ,  from backend responses.
        -   **Loading State & Timeout**: Improved handling for large data fetches to prevent premature display of zero values.
-   
    -   **Summary**: Main React application file, including routing, context, and login logic.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   **Admin Login Redirection**: Implemented programmatic navigation using  after successful admin login to redirect to the  dashboard.
        -   **Error Handling**: Improved error handling within  to provide better feedback.
        -   **API Constant**: Added a fallback for  to prevent  issues.
        -   **Loading State**: Added a loading state to the admin login button.
-    & 
    -   **Summary**: Configuration files for environment variables.
    -   **Changes Made**:  in  updated to MongoDB Atlas connection string (e.g., ) and  to . Password in  was URL-encoded. Frontend  in  points to the preview environment.
-   
    -   **Summary**: Documentation for testing protocols, user problem statements, and agent communications.
    -   **Changes Made**: Continuously updated with resolved issues, new tasks, and communication logs, particularly for dashboard data display, MongoDB Atlas integration, and frontend login fixes.
-    (NEW temporary scripts, e.g., , , , , )
    -   **Summary**: Various Python scripts created dynamically to facilitate direct, batched uploading of large JSON datasets (Vendite, Fidelity, Scontrini) to MongoDB Atlas, addressing in-app loading issues and ensuring data persistence. These scripts were crucial for recovering from data loss.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Data Persistence Verification**: Confirm that the recently uploaded  (containing 32,233 records) is fully persisted in MongoDB Atlas and is consistently accessible and visible in the admin dashboard, especially for specific card numbers (e.g., ).
-   **Database Consistency**: Investigate and fix the root cause of the recurring data loss/reversion to older datasets in MongoDB Atlas after deployments or restarts, which has repeatedly led to the dashboard displaying zero values or incomplete data.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was actively troubleshooting a critical data inconsistency issue. The user reported that despite previous successful data uploads and dashboard functionality, certain fidelity cards were not found in the admin dashboard (specifically ), and the database seemed to revert to an older state (24,958 fidelity records instead of the expected 32,233).

The AI engineer's last actions involved:
1.  **Verifying Data Presence**: Checked MongoDB Atlas directly to confirm the number of fidelity records, which was found to be 24,958, confirming the user's report of reverted data.
2.  **Checking Fidelity Card**: Searched for the specific card number  within the *latest* uploaded  file. The card was *not found* in this file.
3.  **Diagnosing Data Loss**: Concluded that the MongoDB Atlas might be performing automatic backups/restorations to older states, or the backend in production has a recovery mechanism. It was also noted that the specific card number requested by the user was not present in the *new* dataset provided.
4.  **Acknowledging Synchronization Issue**: Recognized that while the direct uploads temporarily show correct data, the production environment/Atlas keeps reverting.

The current state is that the application is deployed and functional in terms of its codebase and API endpoints, but the MongoDB Atlas database is not consistently retaining the latest uploaded data, leading to the dashboard displaying an older or incomplete dataset. The specific card requested is also not found in the *provided* updated fidelity file.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Verify the content of the user-provided  for the missing card, then re-evaluate the data synchronization and persistence in MongoDB Atlas.
