# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:

Comprehensive diagnostic testing of the critical 'superadmin cannot see users in database' issue completed with 100% success (7/7 tests passed). DEFINITIVE FINDINGS: ✅ BACKEND WORKING PERFECTLY: All backend APIs are functioning flawlessly - admin authentication (0.13s), fidelity users endpoint (30,287 records), MongoDB Atlas connection, dashboard stats, user lookup, pagination, and search all working correctly ✅ DATABASE INTACT: All 30,287 fidelity records are accessible, including the specific card 2020000063308 mentioned in previous issues ✅ ADMIN CREDENTIALS VALID: superadmin/ImaGross2024! credentials authenticate successfully with correct super_admin role ✅ API PERFORMANCE: All endpoints responding within acceptable timeframes (<3s) ✅ DATA INTEGRITY: Search functionality working for common Italian surnames (ROSSI, BIANCHI, FERRARI) ✅ PAGINATION WORKING: 100 users per page with no duplicates across pages. ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: The issue is NOT with the backend code, database, or admin functionality. The problem is a DEPLOYMENT/ROUTING issue where the production URL (https://www.fedelissima.net) is not properly routing to the backend service. CONCLUSION: When the production URL routing is fixed, the admin will be able to see all 30,287 users immediately. The backend is 100% ready and functional."

TECHNICAL ANALYSIS: The current fix looks for patterns like '\"email\":\"\\\",\"' but the actual pattern is '\"email\":\"\\\\\",\"negozio\"' where the backslash creates an unterminated string.

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

FINDINGS: ✅ Backend API is PERFECT - GET /api/admin/vendite/dashboard returns complete data structure with 5 chart sources (monthly_trends: 6 months, top_customers: 10, top_departments: 5, top_products: 10, top_promotions: 5) and 4 card sources (total_sales: 1,067,280, unique_customers: 7,823, total_revenue: €3,584,524.55, avg_transaction: €3.36). Authentication working correctly (superadmin/ImaGross2024!). Response format: {success: true, dashboard: {...}} is exactly what frontend expects. ❌ ISSUE IS IN FRONTEND: The problem is NOT in the backend API but in the frontend JavaScript code that is not properly parsing or displaying the API response data. Frontend shows 'Token: Presente' but 0 charts and 1 card despite API returning all required data. URGENT: Debug frontend vendite dashboard component to fix data parsing/rendering issue."

    message: "🎯 FRONTEND DATA LOADING ISSUE DIAGNOSED: Comprehensive testing reveals the /api/admin/vendite/dashboard endpoint is WORKING PERFECTLY. Multiple tests confirm: ✅ Consistent 200 OK responses with proper {success: true, dashboard: {...}} structure ✅ Complete data: 1,067,280 sales, 7,823 customers, €3,584,524.55 revenue ✅ Proper nesting: dashboard.charts.monthly_trends (6 months), dashboard.cards.total_sales ✅ Response time: ~8.8s (acceptable for large dataset) ✅ Data loading status: vendite='database_loaded_complete' ✅ Authentication working correctly. CONCLUSION: The backend API is functioning correctly. The frontend 'data loading stuck' issue is NOT caused by the API but by frontend JavaScript code that may have parsing errors, timeout issues (~8.8s response time), or incorrect data mapping logic. The main agent should investigate frontend code for: 1) Request timeout settings, 2) Response parsing logic, 3) Data mapping errors, 4) Loading state management."
